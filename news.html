<b>ARSENAL: ALEXIS SANCHEZ</b>  
<br>
<br>
Sanchez has been in the centre of transfer sagas with nobody knowing what will be the next step for him with rumours that Barcelona, Man City and Man United interested in signing the 29 year old from Chile.
<br>
No doubt Sanchez is aware of these rumours as he hasn't been at the form that he's capable of, in 16 games he's only scored five goals and three assists compared to last season when he had 12 goals and five assists at the same stage.

<b>CHELSEA: INJUNCTION OBTAINED</B>  
<br>
Chelsea FC have been handed an injunction from a high court due to multiple trespass incidents at Stamford Bridge on various dates. Chelsea have now joined the likes of Manchester City and Manchester United in getting injunctions after urban climbers scaled their stadiums for videos to post on social networking websites.
